Recrusion and backtracking

In this project we can see how recursion (and backtracking) work trough some exercises like Knight's tour, N Queen problem, Rat in a Maze, Hanoi towers, Factorial, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Bubble sort, Sudoku. 
Besides these we can find some exercises without visualization what we can try to solve alone, but the result are everywhere indicated.This work maybe can help you better understand how's work the recursion in the programming field. 

For the preparation we used vanilla javascript, HTML and CSS.
