# Overview of the Application
**Recrusion and backtracking**

In this project we can see how **recursion** (and **backtracking**) work trough some exercises like **Knight's tour**, **N Queen problem**, **Rat in a Maze**, **Hanoi towers**, **Factorial**, **Merge Sort**, **Quick Sort**, **Bubble sort**, **Sudoku**. 
Besides these we can find some exercises without visualization what we can try to solve alone (35 tasks in total), but the solution are everywhere indicated. This project maybe can help you better understand how's work the **recursion** in the programming field.
Unfortunately the entire project is in Hungarian.

## Technological Stack
For the preparation we used vanilla **Javascript**, **HTML** and **CSS** (You can find some C too).

IDE: VSCode, Extension: Live Server
